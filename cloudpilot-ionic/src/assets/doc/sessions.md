On the "sessions" tab you can manage your emulation sessions. Each session corresponds
to a virtual device and its state.

# Importing new sessions

Select the "+" icon in the upper right corner in order to import a ROM or a session image.

# The session list

Selecting a session from the list will launch the session in the emulator and take you
to the emulation tab.

Swiping a session to the left or right will reveal options to save, edit, reset and delete
a session. On devices that have a mouse or trackpad you can also do a right click on
a session in order to open a context menu with the same options.

## Edit

Edit a session in order to change its name and the hotsync name used by the session.

## Save
